# Research: Investigating the Shelf-Life API for Integration with Inventory

## Purpose
The API provides valuable information regarding the shelf life of food, which can enhance our app by providing some automation and giving users recommendations.

## Learning
I expect to learn how to interact with the Shelf-Life API, understand the routes, and determine how to integrate this external data into our application. Specifically, I will focus on:
- Using the `/search` route to find relevant food guides based on grocery items stored in our database.
- Using `/guides/:guideId` to retrieve detailed storage information.

## Doing
I expect to write a new API interaction module in the backend, which will handle:
- Calling the Shelf-Life API.
- Processing the data.
- Updating the inventory database with food shelf-life information and tips.
  
I will also need to modify our existing database to store additional fields, such as storage methods and tips for each food item. Specifically, I will write code to map grocery items to the APIâ€™s food guides and integrate the results into the UI for users to view.

### Steps include:
- **Modify SQLite Database Schema**: Add fields for shelf-life duration, recommended storage methods, and storage tips.
- **Fetch data from the Shelf-Life API** based on the item name when a new grocery item is added or updated.
- **Call Shelf-Life API** when a new item is added or edited, store the retrieved data in the database, and fetch this data along with grocery items in the API response sent to the frontend.
- **Front-end adjustments** to display shelf-life information and storage tips.
- **Testing**: Ensure proper API functionality, UI display, and error handling.

## Task
- **Shelf Life API Integration**
